You may need several additional dependencies. % cargo build --no-default-features --features http3-s2n --release Then you have an executive binary rust-rpxy/target/release/rpxy.\nNote that we do not have an option of installation via crates.io, i.e., cargo install, at this point since some dependencies are not published yet. Alternatively, you can use docker image (see below) as the easiest way for amd64 environment. Package Installation for Linux (RPM/DEB) # You can find the Jenkins CI/CD build scripts for rpxy in the ./.build directory.\nPrebuilt packages for Linux RPM and DEB are available at https://rpxy.gamerboy59.dev, provided by @Gamerboy59.\nNext: Command Line Options "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/configuration/","title":"Configuration","section":"Docs","content":" Full Configuration # "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/getting_started/cmd_options/","title":"Command Line Options","section":"Getting Started","content":" Command Line Options # "}]
